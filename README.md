WIP!!!! THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND EXPECT A LACK OF POLISH.

This mod requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods).

Use WSD or the arrow keys to move the indicator and drop balls.

Many features do not function, such as most Jokers, card modifiers, and saving the game during a blind. Also some UI looks weird.

If you have any queries, idea suggestions, or bug notices, feel free to reach out to me via the [discord discussion thread](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1439235829229813834)!
