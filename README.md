WIP!!!! THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND EXPECT A LACK OF POLISH.

This mod requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods).

Use WSD or the arrow keys to move the indicator and drop balls.

Many features do not function, such as most Jokers, card modifiers, and saving the game during a blind. Also some UI looks weird.
