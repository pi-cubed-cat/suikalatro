WIP!!!! THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND EXPECT A LACK OF POLISH.

This mod requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods).

Use WSD or the arrow keys to move the indicator and drop balls.

Many vanilla cards and features are not present, and saving the state of balls in a blind doesn't occur. Also some UI looks weird.

If you have any queries, idea suggestions, or bug notices, feel free to reach out to me via the [discord discussion thread](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1439235829229813834)!
